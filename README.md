## Description
This is a personal page. The main aim is to interact with the user where they can know details of myself.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
There's no user sign up because the building languages were Html and CSS.

## Technologies Used
I used the HTML to describe the structure of the information on my webpage. The CSS was used for styling the pages' apperance.

## Support and contact details
